## Sentinel Synergy: Revolutionizing Aqua Sump Systems with Automated Ventilation and Integrated Self-Diagnostics for Advanced Home Safety
Traditional systems often focus on detecting a single type of gas, lack advanced user interfaces, and operate in isolation from other home systems. Moreover, these devices typically lack self-maintenance features, which can lead to undetected malfunctions over time.

The Sentinel Synergy project addresses this need by integrating industrial-grade features into a household IoT solution, aiming to set a new standard in residential protection.       

## About
Household gas detection systems are often limited to monitoring a single gas, leaving homeowners vulnerable to a wider range of potential hazards. 
Current consumer-grade gas detectors typically feature basic, non-intuitive alarms, such as simple beeps or LED indicators. 
Household gas detectors are usually standalone devices that alert users but do not take automatic action.
Consumer-grade gas detectors generally lack the advanced self-diagnostics and auto-calibration features found in industrial systems. Without these capabilities, household devices are prone to sensor drift, reduced accuracy, and undetected failures, compromising long-term safety.
Addressing these challenges, the Sentinel Synergy project seeks to enhance home safety by integrating multi-gas detection, advanced user interfaces, automatic shutoff, smart ventilation control, and self-diagnostics into a comprehensive IoT-based system.
